## Project Overview
This project implements a **Heart Disease Prediction system** using machine learning.  
It predicts whether a patient has heart disease based on medical features such as age, cholesterol, blood pressure, chest pain type, and more.  
The model is trained using a **Random Forest Classifier** to achieve accurate and reliable predictions.

---

## Dataset
- **File:** `heart.csv`  
- **Features:** Age, Sex, Chest Pain Type, Resting Blood Pressure, Cholesterol, Fasting Blood Sugar, Rest ECG Results, Max Heart Rate, Exercise-Induced Angina, ST Depression, Slope of ST, Number of Major Vessels, Thalassemia  
- **Target:** `condition` (converted to binary: 0 = No Disease, 1 = Disease)

---

## Project Workflow
1. **Data Loading & Cleaning** ‚Äì Load the dataset and preprocess the target column.  
2. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)** ‚Äì Visualize distribution of data and feature correlations.  
3. **Feature Scaling** ‚Äì Standardize features for better model performance.  
4. **Model Training** ‚Äì Train a Random Forest Classifier.  
5. **Evaluation** ‚Äì Measure accuracy, confusion matrix, and classification report.  
6. **Feature Importance** ‚Äì Visualize top features contributing to predictions.
